# Jitalk
Team [Hackateers'](https://github.com/koding/global.hackathon/blob/master/Teams/Hackateers/ABOUT.md) submission for Koding Hackathon 2014.

Jitalk (emoji+talk) is a real time chat service that allows people
speaking different languages to communicate in the global language of symbols.

## Description
[![Koding Hackathon](/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

While machine translation (MT) has progressed greatly in the last few years, it is still far from perfect.
Our solution is to avoid the confusing grammar produced by MT systems by instead allowing users to communicate using the global language of symbols.
Jitalk takes text input from users using their native language and translates those into a series of emojis and symbols (from [thenounproject.com](http://thenounproject.com)).
